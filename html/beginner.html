                    what we're doing is we're selecting element with an ID navbarToggle. 
                    ANd if we go and look at our HTML. Let's go and copy that and move it out index.
                    html and let's search for that. So this is our button right here, the navbarToggle, right? That's the button. So if that button loses focus, and as I told you that means on blur, and on blur just means .blur, which is exactly pretty much the same as we would do here. Once we would select it in a regular JavaScript we would say addEventListener and blur is the event. So this what basically we're doing here. We're saying that blur when that happens I want you to execute that function right here and this function just says the following. I want to first grab the screen width and you'll see we're doing window.inner width, which means it's the width of the browser itself not the entire screen of the monitor, and then if the screen width is less than 768, so we're basically checking if we're within that break point where the collapsible button shows up. If that's true, right? And that button lost focus what we want to do is we'll once again select collapsible nav, collapsable nav is that menu, and we could take a look at it right now if we go to index.HTML and search for collapsible nav, and there it is. So you can see that's all our menu items right here. So point is if we select that and apply this function called collapse with a value of hide. Now this collapse function and if you copy+N we'll go to boot strap and we'll search for it in here there's the collapse.js. So this whole thing is coming from inside Bootstrap, but is a plugin to jQuery. So we can't really avoid jQuery unfortunately at least for this course, or fortunately I guess.
                    You now learned a little bit something new. Okay, so now that
